## Confronting a Challenge

* If someone is better than you at something, then it’s likely because she has failed at it more than you have.
* Even if you try and fail, always respond to challenge with:
	* Hard Work
	* Honesty
	* Helping Others as Best We Can (Compassion)
* You can't fail until you quit.
* Failure is an event, not a person. Failing doesn't mean you're a failure.

## Jobs and Work

1. Whatever the work is, do it well - not for the boss but for yourself.
2. You make the job; it doesn't make you.
3. Your real life is with us, your family.
4. You are not the work you do; you are the person you are.

## Resilience

* **Emotional Regulation:** When feelings overwhelm you, you can’t make good decisions. Slow down and get some distance. Notice and name your emotions. Then reappraise. Is this really that bad? Are these thoughts useful?
* **Optimism:** When we can’t see a potential positive outcome, it’s rational to give up. Consider your Best Possible Self. See difficulty as transient, local, and controllable so you stop feeling like a pigeon in life’s shooting gallery.
* **Cognitive Agility:** When you immediately jump to the worst-case scenario, you’re going to want to quit. Take the time to consider more possibilities. And then ask yourself which one you’d bet the mortgage on being most likely. Otherwise, you’ll feel like a shut-in in a house of horrors.
* **Self-Compassion:** You’re letting someone walk all over you. But the person doing the walking is also you. Take that compassion you usually extend to others and offer some of it to yourself.
* **Self-Efficacy:** You build confidence and agency by accomplishing things often enough that it changes how you see yourself. Start small and achieve goals until you start to see yourself as “the kind of person who achieves their goals.”

## Screens
* **School Laptop.** Dedicated laptop through school. Basically no control over the software on this device because it’s managed by the school district. Sometimes they continue work on assignments later than desired, so have a rule that once homework time is done, the laptop gets put into their backpack.
	* *Settings:* Software set by school, we decide when it’s physically available.
	* *Used mostly for:* school work.
	* *Time allowed:* flexible from the time they arrive home from school until dinner time.
* **Macbook Air.** Primary device for academic study, drawing, and YouTube. Use Apple Screen Time settings to regulate what is accessible when and for how long. In general, most apps are only available from 4pm until 6pm on weekdays and 10am until 6pm on weekends. Use App Limits setting to specify that a majority of the apps can only be used for 20 minutes (per app) per day. In the Always Allowed section, a small list of utilities and educational/creative apps can be accessed at any time, overriding the previously established downtime and app limits settings. If more time in a limited access app is needed, they can request permission and we can enter our password to extend access by a few different increments.
	* *Education, reference, and creative apps.*
		* Always available: Weather, Merriam-Webster, DuoLingo, Khan Academy, ProCreate (OutSchool Illustration class), Photos.
		* Time limited: Local library app, ebooks search shortcut, Loopimal (music making), Yokee (singing), Freeform (collaging), BBC Civilizations (history/ed).

	* *Use mostly for:* GAMES, non-Free2Play.
	* *Time allowed:* 30 minutes per token. Flexibility allowed during family playdates.

* **Future Kindle?** On a laptop, have a shortcut to your library's catalog, and/or a shortcut for a filtered Overdrive search of currently available middle-grade Kindle books. Allow them to initiate a borrow, where the parent can into the Amazon Parents Dashboard to release the book to their Kindle. Later, you can revisit this workflow to give them greater autonomy.
	* *Settings:* Bedtime hours 9:30pm-7am, turn off web browsing and video watching, age-targeting for subscription content, removal of some unwanted Amazon Kids+ content.

## Self-care for Kids

* **Take belly breaths.** Don’t underestimate the power of a deep breath to reset. Breathe in and breathe out a positive phrase or empowering mantra. When your child breathes in, have them repeat something like: I am creative and kind. On their exhale, they can say, I can make good decisions. Have them repeat this a few times. Older children can brainstorm their own self-care affirmations to memorize — or perhaps write on a sticky note and place somewhere where they can take a break to read it, like on a bathroom mirror or bedroom door.
* **Get silly.** When a child is having a tough time or cycling through big emotions, ask silly questions to help them reset. Asking a concrete question they know the answer to helps re-route their thinking. Ask questions like: What color is the sky? What did you have for breakfast? Where is your shoe? Even if they answer incorrectly, you’re helping their brain and body calm down and get back into the zone. Encourage your child that when they have big feelings, they can pay attention to the room around them and name five things they see as a way to “reset” their brains.
* **Be proactive.** When seeing signs that a child might be stressed, or there is a big change coming, or if they’ve had a particularly challenging day, give them a special mission to complete. Perhaps it’s asking a child to carry books into another room, or getting the mail. This helps them see that it’s okay to take a break — and in fact, getting their bodies moving is a form of self-care.
* **Incorporate rest.** Think creatively about your child’s unique personality, age, and interest to brainstorm small pockets of rest in their daily routine. Perhaps it’s a time with books in their bedroom, or a ten-minute drawing break at the kitchen table. Dedicating time (We’re going to spend 10 minutes taking a break to draw or write!) and space — like the kitchen table — shows kids that getting our thoughts and feelings out matters. I find that providing prompts (When your brother knocked down your tower, how did that make you feel? What was the happiest part of your day?) helps them stay focused.
* **Get the wiggles out.** Sometimes we just need to move our bodies. Not only does it get our blood pumping, but it can be a great mood balancer, too. Try a one-minute dance break or challenge your child to 15 jumping jacks. I love these these ideas for releasing kids’ energy while staying indoors. Doing something physical and involving like this is great self-care for kids because it also brings them back into their bodies and the present moment. This act of getting back into the present is known as mindfulness, and by setting up physical movement as a strategy your kids can use, you’re helping them to be mindful without even knowing it.
* **Take a break.** Simply asking, Do you need to take a break? Or saying, Let’s take a break!, when I notice a child having a hard time has done wonders. (I’m always trying to channel Mom Tiger.) I make sure not to shame and we try to normalize taking breaks as a way to keep ourselves healthy. Having a designated break spot to go to is helpful. And as they get older, the goal is that they’ll be able to name when they need to take a break.
* **Have a healthy snack.** Nourishing our bodies and making sure we have the fuel we need to get through the day is a vital part of self-care for kids. If your child is feeling a little “hangry,” encourage them to recognize and name this sensation, and then suggest a nutritious nibble. In my house, we try to opt for grab-and-go snacks that have protein (cheese sticks, nuts, greek yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, or crackers with peanut butter).

## Urge vs. Action

> Really, what we have to teach our kids is how to differentiate urge from action. For example, having the urge to hit is okay; hitting a person is not okay. We know this to be true in our adult lives — that there’s a big difference between being angry and then doing something rash or irresponsible or hurtful out of anger. We know that we can type the email and not send it. We know that we can want to quit on the spot but think better of it.

> Parents often have the goal of getting rid of the urge *(What’s wrong with you? Why would you want to hurt someone?)*, but it’s better to humanize the urge and shift where we allow a child to discharge it, because it allows the child to gain regulation and, over time, make better decisions.

> Instead of shaming them for the feeling *(which is not in their control)* empower them about their actions *(which are much more in their control)*. Our job is to teach them about regulation, about redirection, about our ability to realize we’re going down a bad road, stop and turn around. It’s also to teach them about the responsibility to evaluate after we’ve lost control, apologize, repair and learn from what happened.
