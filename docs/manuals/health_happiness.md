# Health & Happiness

## Anxiety
Perhaps the metaphor "energy" is the energy the brain expends to continuously compute social requirements and the extent to which you see others as an emotional threat. This causes your brain to keep its "shields up", which can feel exhausting. I feel drained when I think people may potentially judge me: during extended family events, class reunions or ceremonies, but I feel perfectly fine amongst a small group of friends or strangers at the pub. Relatedly, alcohol can also dramatically reduce the drain.

### The Cynic
The point is to see what value we can find in a paper, not what flaws. Our purpose is to learn and to grow knowledge. Papers are written by humans; every one has flaws. If flaws disqualify, every paper is disqualified. They are experimental, pushing the frontier of knowledge. Your work, your hard work, is to see what you can get out of them.

## Disappointment & Frustration
Successful, talented people are often frustrated for a simple reason: The world is constantly disappointing them. They expect everyone to be like them, to work as hard as them, to care as much as them, to hold themselves to the same standards as they do. And if not that, at the very least, we expect people to show up and do their jobs.

It’s the difference between these expectations and reality that makes us angry. It’s understandable, but that doesn’t make it okay. Because not only is this a miserable way to live, but worse, it makes other people miserable, too. And, that’s what is particularly inexcusable. You’re not allowed to externalize your crap onto other people. You can’t make the world worse because of your own inflexibility.

It’s not manly to get angry, Marcus Aurelius wrote. It’s not natural either. It’s better to be calm and controlled, he said. It’s better to treat people with kindness. Don’t go expecting Plato’s Republic, he said. If there are brambles in the path, he said, go around. Why get angry? As if the world will care or notice.

It’s wonderful that you have high standards. It’s wonderful that you are demanding of yourself. It’s wonderful that you do your job. But you have to be willing to be flexible and tolerant with other people. You have to be patient. You have to keep your frustrations in check. That’s what Stoicism is about. That’s what the point of all this is.

Don’t let yourself get away with anything less.  

## Home Blood Pressure Monitoring
1. Don’t smoke, drink caffeinated beverages or exercise within 30 minutes before taking your blood pressure. Empty your bladder.
2. Remove the clothing over the arm that will be used to measure blood pressure.
3. You can use either arm. Usually there is not a big difference between readings on them.
4. Be still. Allow at least five minutes of quiet rest before measurements. Don’t talk or use the phone.
5. Sit with your back straight and supported (on a dining chair, rather than a sofa). Your feet should be flat on the floor. Do not cross your legs. Support your arm on a flat surface. The middle of the cuff should be placed on the upper arm at heart level.
6. Take the readings at the same time each day.
7. Each time you measure, take two readings one minute apart.

## Long Life
* Don't smoke. Drink lightly or not at all.
* Get a mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercise, ideally 45 mins per day.
* Largely avoid processed and premade foods, and keep sugar consumption to a minimum. Eat mostly plants and lean protein.
* Sleep 8+ hours per night.
* Socialize and build relationships. They're good for you mentally, emotionally, and physically.
* Preventative healthcare. In your 40s and 50s, see a primary care provider from time to time to be on top of screening tests (Hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and colonoscopies, etc.).
* Be mindful of UV exposure, especially if you live somewhere where you get lots of sun.
* Keep mentally and physically active as you age. Fill retirement with something that gets you up, active, and around people.
