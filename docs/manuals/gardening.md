	3. Remove all soil from root ball
	4. Remove one-third of remaining roots
	5. Root directly below trunk
	6. Cut large/woody root back to smaller root branch
	7. Remove circling/abnormal roots
3. Blueberries (ideal: narrow base, open in center):
	1. Remove low spreading branches
	2. Remove old, non-reddish canes
	3. Thin branches in center
	4. Head back upright bull shoots to control height
	5. Thin short, thin shoots
	6. Cut up to one-third of branches
