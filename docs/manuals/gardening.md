## Container Watering Guidelines

1. When skewer pushed deep into soil is dry
3. Water until water drains from bottom
4. Repeat watering after 5 minutes

* Flush after every 6th watering:
	1. Slowly pour water until saturation
	2. Wait at least 15 minutes
	3. Quickly flush with large volume
	4. Drain completely by tilting or shaking
	5. Water normally with fertilizer application

## Fertilizer & Pests

- Yellowing leaves in hydro = calcium deficient? Add cal-mag?
* Apply dry fertilizer in MAR/JUL.
* Apply liquid fertilizer weekly.
* Apply fish emulsion monthly.
* 40% milk:water spray for powdery mildew.

## Repotting Steps

* Repot large perennial containers after 3 years.

1. Discard existing soil
2. Tree/hops roots (ideal: inverted bowl shape):
	1. During dormancy
	2. Saw off bottom third of root ball
	3. Remove all soil from root ball
	4. Remove one-third of remaining roots
	5. Root directly below trunk
	6. Cut large/woody root back to smaller root branch
	7. Remove circling/abnormal roots
3. Blueberries (ideal: narrow base, open in center):
	1. Remove low spreading branches
	2. Remove old, non-reddish canes
	3. Thin branches in center
	4. Head back upright bull shoots to control height
	5. Thin short, thin shoots
	6. Cut up to one-third of branches

* Varieties for PNW: Jaune Flamme, Principe Borghese, Costuluto Fiorentino, Sungold.
* Minimum 5 gallon container per tomato.
* If buying, use 4-inch starts, then transplant into 1 gallon containers until ready to plant.
* Transplant to garden in late May.
* Plant horizontally into a trench as deep as the root ball is wide, angling so leaves remain above soil line.
* If leaves turn purple, supplement with liquid fertilizer.
